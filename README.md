# JackalAIRace
A self driving AI (using genetic model) made on Unity using C#.

This project has been done in a rush of 24h
## AI saves
By default the AI is saved via the path contained in the script `./Assets/Scripts/SavePath.cs`

## Generation configuration
The AI takes the `Spawner.selected` for breeding and makes different types of childs (see the `./Assets/Scripts/NeuralNetwork.cs` script to see all mutation functions that have been implemented).
